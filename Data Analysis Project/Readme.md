Data analysis project largely based on the same as the Python for Data Analysis course at the DSA Academy, mainly in relation to the 10 questions and plotting.

In the project, the IMDB database was loaded, available in SQLite, and then the following 10 business questions were answered:<br/>

4- What is the Median Rating of Films Regarding the Year of Premiere?<br/>
5- What is the number of films evaluated by genre in relation to the year of debut?<br/>
6- What is the longest running movie? Calculate the percentiles.<br/>
7- What is the relationship between duration and genre?<br/>
8- What is the number of films produced per country?<br/>
9- What are the Top 10 Best Films?<br/>
10- What are the Top 10 Worst Movies?

Tools Used: Python, SQLite, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, MatPlotLib and Scikit-Learn.<br/>
Requirements: Python, Pip Install (To install the modules above) and some IDE for development, in the development of the project Jupyter Notebook was used.
