My name is Nelson Lucas and I am 21 years old, on this portfolio i will present some of my projects on Data Science and FullStack programming.

I started programming in 2018 when i entered college, and i went deeper in 2020 when i went deeper into the FullStack area motivated by my experiences in college, in 2021 i was more interested in the Data Science area and decided to delve deeper into the subject.

The Portfolio will be more focused on my recent projects, all Data Science with Python, since the projects i did in college, besides being a little old, have incomplete codes.
